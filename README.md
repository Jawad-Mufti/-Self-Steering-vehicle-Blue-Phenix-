### Build the project
Processing image data with OpenCV using C++
This C++-template demonstrates how to develop a software module to process video data (eg., image detection, etc.) to be used with Kiwi.

### Prerequisites:

You need to install Docker for your platform
You need to install docker-compose
You have a recording file (.rec).
Building and testing the software module for your laptop (replay mode)
This template folder contains everything you need to compile and run a C++ software component that uses OpenCV for image processing. We are using Docker to build and run the resulting binary.


Step 1: Assuming that you have a folder ~/recordings, where you have at least one .rec file from your experiments with Kiwi.

Step 2: Clone this repository:

cd $HOME
git clone git@github.com:Jawad-Mufti/Self-Steering-vehicle-Blue-Phenix.git
cd template/working_with_records/cpp-opencv/src
Step 3: Now, you can start the h264 decoder and webapp for replaying as follows (the actual h264 decoder is built once during the first call):
docker-compose -f h264-decoder-viewer.yml up

### Tools
* Docker

* cluon library (from chalmers)  more instructions to work with cluon and opendlv :  https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv-device-ps3controller
* C formatting tools
* CMake 
* Git
* Visual Studio



### Addition of features
During the weekly discussions, we will discuss what is to be added during the upcoming working week. Once agreed upon, the new tasks will be added to trello where the progress can be tracked.
If a new feature is to be added on gitlab, the user will create a new branch to work on, to avoid merge conflicts in the master. The new features will be developed and tested until we feel they are safe to merge with the master.

### Fixing Bugs
The code will be run, tested and reviewed in feature branches in order to find any unexpected behavior. If any issues are found in the code we will notify the team for a discussion to take place. Then we will use the tools in Visual Studio to debug and discuss solutions in our upcoming meeting.
