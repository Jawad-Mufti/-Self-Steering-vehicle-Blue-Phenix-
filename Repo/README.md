### Tools
* Docker
* C formatting tools
* CMake Tools
* Git
* Visual Studio


### Addition of features
During the weekly discussions, we will discuss what is to be added during the upcoming working week. Once agreed upon, the new tasks will be added to trello where the progress can be tracked. 
If a new feature is to be added on gitlab, the user will create a new branch to work on, to avoid merge conflicts in the master. The new features will be developed and tested until we feel they are safe to merge with the master.

### Fixing Bugs
The code will be run, tested and reviewed in feature branches in order to find any unexpected behavior. If any issues are found in the code we will notify the team for a discussion to take place. Then we will use the tools in Visual Studio to debug and discuss solutions in our upcoming meeting.
